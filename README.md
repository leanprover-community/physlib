## Requirements of the project

🎯 The project shall contain results (definitions, theorems, lemmas and calculations) from **physics** formalized (or **digitalized**) into the interactive theorem prover **Lean 4**.

🎯 The project shall be **organized** by **physics**.

🎯 Each definition in the project shall carry a physics-based **documentation**.

🎯 Each module (file) in the project shall carry a physics-based **documentation**.

🎯 The project shall contain Physics Lean **tactics**, **notation** and **syntax** for physicists.

🎯 The project shall *not* be tied to physics axiomizations (e.g. axiomatic QFT), but rather lexiable enough to accommodate different approaches and starting points.

🎯 The content of the project shall be carefully **reviewed** and curated, to ensure reusability, readability and fit.

🎯 The project shall be completely open-source, community run and independent from any company or organization.

🎯 The project shall not be tied to any specific AI model or tool.

🎯 The project shall be for **main-stream** physics only.


## How to get involved

See the [Get Involved](https://physlean.com/GetInvolved.html) for more details. Some suggestions:

📣 write **informal** results - no need to learn Lean for this - see the [Getting Started](https://physlean.com/GettingStarted) page for more details,

📣 tackle a [TODO item](https://physlean.com/TODOList),

📣 or, start formalizing an area that you find interesting.

Feel free to come to the [PhysLean zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/479953-PhysLean/) to ask questions and advice.

> [!NOTE]
> When making contributing to PhysLean it is much better to do it with small steps. This makes it easier for us to review, and allows you to get feedback sooner.

### Papers referencing PhysLean
- Hu, Jiewen, Thomas Zhu, and Sean Welleck. "miniCTX: Neural Theorem Proving with (Long-) Contexts." arXiv preprint [arXiv:2408.03350](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.03350) (2024). [Project page]( https://cmu-l3.github.io/minictx/)

How PhysLean (then called HepLean) was used: *Theorems from the space-time files of HepLean were included in a data set used to evaluate the ability of models to prove theorems from real-world repositories, which requires working with definitions, theorems, and other context not seen in training.*

## Contributing

We would love to have you involved! See the [Get Involved](https://physlean.com/GetInvolved.html) page to see how you can get involved.
Any contributions are welcome! If you have any questions or want permission  permission to create a pull-request for this
repository contact Joseph Tooby-Smith on the [Lean Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com), or email.

## Installation

If you want to play around with PhysLean, but do not want to download Lean, then you can use [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/HEPLean/HepLean).

### Installing Lean 4

Installation instructions for Lean 4 can be found:

- https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html

or

- https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html

### Installing PhysLean

- Clone this repository (or download the repository as a Zip file)
- Open a terminal at the top-level in the corresponding directory.
- Run `lake exe cache get`. The command `lake` should have been installed when you installed Lean.
- Run `lake build`.
- Open the directory (not a single file) in Visual Studio Code (or another Lean compatible code editor).
