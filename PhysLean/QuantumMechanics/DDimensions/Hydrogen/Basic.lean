# Hydrogen atom

This module introduces the `d`-dimensional hydrogen atom with `1/r` potential.

In addition to the dimension `d`, the quantum mechanical system is characterized by
a mass `m > 0` and constant `k` appearing in the potential `V = -k/r`.
The standard hydrogen atom has `d=3`, `m = mₑmₚ/(mₑ + mₚ) ≈ mₑ` and `k = e²/4πε₀`.

The potential `V = -k/r` is singular at the origin. To address this we define a regularized
Hamiltonian in which the potential is replaced by `-k(r(ε)⁻¹ + ½ε²r(ε)⁻³)`, where
`r(ε)² = ‖x‖² + ε²`. The `ε²/r³` term limits to the zero distribution for `ε → 0`
but is convenient to include for two reasons:
- It improves the convergence: `r(ε)⁻¹ + ½ε²r(ε)⁻³ = r⁻¹(1 + O(ε⁴/r⁴))` with no `O(ε²/r²)` term.
- It is what appears in the commutators of the (regularized) LRL vector components.
