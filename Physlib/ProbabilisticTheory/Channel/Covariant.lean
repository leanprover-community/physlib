# Covariant channels

Channels that commute with two group actions by reversible transformations.

## i. Overview

More general channels may lose information but can still respect the symmetries of a system. This
is captured by covariance: a channel `Φ` between two spaces carrying group actions `ρ` and `σ` by
reversible transformations is covariant, or intertwining, if

`Φ ∘ ρ g = σ g ∘ Φ` for every group element `g`.

Covariance preserves invariant states under pullback. A reversible transformation is covariant
exactly when the target action is the transport of the source action. Together with the reversible
transformations, this gives a common framework for symmetries and dynamics of observable spaces.

## ii. Key results

- `IsIntertwining`: Covariance of a channel under two group actions.
- `IsIntertwining.comap_isInvariant`: Pullback of invariant states along covariant channels.
- `Reversible.isIntertwining_iff_eq_transport`: Characterization of the transported action.
