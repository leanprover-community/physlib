## B. Relation to other types of initial conditions

We relate the initial condition given by an initial position and an initial velocity
to other specifications of initial conditions.

In this section, we implement alternative ways to specify initial conditions for the harmonic
oscillator. The standard `InitialConditions` type specifies position and velocity at time `t=0`,
but in practice it is often useful to specify initial conditions at other times or in other forms.

Currently implemented:
- **Initial conditions at arbitrary time**: Specify position and velocity at any time `t₀`,
  not necessarily at `t=0`.
  This is useful for problems where the natural reference time is not zero.
- **Initial conditions from two positions at different times**: Specify the position at two
  distinct times `t₁` and `t₂` that satisfy the non-degeneracy condition.
- **Initial conditions from two velocities at different times**: Specify the velocity at two
  distinct times `t₁` and `t₂` that satisfy the non-degeneracy condition.
- **Amplitude–phase parametrization**: Specify the solution as a single shifted cosine
  `x(t) = A cos (ω t - φ)` with amplitude `A` and phase `φ`.

All alternative forms can be converted to the standard `InitialConditions` type via conversion
functions, and we prove that the converted initial conditions produce trajectories that satisfy
the original specifications.

### B.1. Initial conditions at arbitrary time

We define a type for initial conditions specified at an arbitrary time `t₀`, rather than at `t=0`.
This is useful when the natural reference point for a problem is not at time zero.

The conversion to the standard `InitialConditions` works by "running the trajectory backward in
time" from `t₀` to `0`. Given that we know `x(t₀)` and `v(t₀)`, we use the harmonic oscillator
solution formula with time-reversal to determine what `x(0)` and `v(0)` must have been.

Mathematically, if `x(t) = cos(ωt)·x₀ + (sin(ωt)/ω)·v₀`, then setting `t = t₀`:
  `x(t₀) = cos(ωt₀)·x₀ + (sin(ωt₀)/ω)·v₀`
  `v(t₀) = -ω·sin(ωt₀)·x₀ + cos(ωt₀)·v₀`

Solving this linear system for `x₀` and `v₀` gives the formulas in `toInitialConditions` below.

-/

/-- Initial conditions for the harmonic oscillator specified at an arbitrary time `t₀`.

  This structure allows specifying the position and velocity at any time `t₀`, not necessarily
  at `t=0`. This is useful for problems where the natural reference time is not zero.

  The conditions can be converted to the standard `InitialConditions` format (at `t=0`)
  using the `toInitialConditions` function. -/

namespace InitialConditionsAtTime

/-- Convert initial conditions at time `t₀` to standard initial conditions at `t=0`.

  This conversion uses the harmonic oscillator solution formula with time-reversal.
  The resulting `InitialConditions` will produce a trajectory that passes through
  `xT₀` with velocity `vT₀` at time `t₀`.

  See `toInitialConditions_trajectory_at_t₀` and `toInitialConditions_velocity_at_t₀` for

### B.2. Initial conditions from two positions at different times

We define a type for initial conditions specified by two measured positions `xT₁` and `xT₂`
at two distinct times `t₁` and `t₂`.

The conversion to the standard `InitialConditions` is obtained by solving for `x₀` and `v₀` the
two equations given by evaluating the trajectory at `t₁` and `t₂`:
  `xT₁ = cos(ωt₁)·x₀ + (sin(ωt₁)/ω)·v₀`
  `xT₂ = cos(ωt₂)·x₀ + (sin(ωt₂)/ω)·v₀`

This linear system has determinant `(cos(ωt₁)·sin(ωt₂) - cos(ωt₂)·sin(ωt₁))/ω = sin(ω(t₂-t₁))/ω`.
Writing `Δ = sin(ω(t₂-t₁))`, solving the system gives the formulas used below:
  `x₀ = (sin(ωt₂)·xT₁ - sin(ωt₁)·xT₂)/Δ`
  `v₀ = ω·(cos(ωt₁)·xT₂ - cos(ωt₂)·xT₁)/Δ`

The conversion is defined as a total function, but it recovers the initial conditions only when
`Δ = sin(ω(t₂-t₁)) ≠ 0`, i.e. when `t₂ - t₁` is not an integer multiple of half a period. The
correctness proofs, under this nondegeneracy condition, are given later in section D.2.

### B.3. Initial conditions from two velocities at different times

We define a type for initial conditions specified by two measured velocities `vT₁` and `vT₂`
at two distinct times `t₁` and `t₂`.

The conversion to the standard `InitialConditions` is obtained by solving for `x₀` and `v₀` the
two equations given by evaluating the velocity of the trajectory at `t₁` and `t₂`:
  `vT₁ = -ω·sin(ωt₁)·x₀ + cos(ωt₁)·v₀`
  `vT₂ = -ω·sin(ωt₂)·x₀ + cos(ωt₂)·v₀`

This linear system has determinant `ω·(cos(ωt₁)·sin(ωt₂) - cos(ωt₂)·sin(ωt₁)) = ω·sin(ω(t₂-t₁))`.
Writing `Δ = sin(ω(t₂-t₁))`, solving the system gives the formulas used below:
  `x₀ = (cos(ωt₂)·vT₁ - cos(ωt₁)·vT₂)/(ω·Δ)`
  `v₀ = (sin(ωt₂)·vT₁ - sin(ωt₁)·vT₂)/Δ`

The conversion is defined as a total function, but it recovers the initial conditions only when
`Δ = sin(ω(t₂-t₁)) ≠ 0`, i.e. when `t₂ - t₁` is not an integer multiple of half a period. The
correctness proofs, under this nondegeneracy condition, are given later in section D.3.

## C. The zero initial conditions

The zero initial conditions are the initial conditions with zero initial position
and zero initial velocity.

In the end, we will see that this corresponds to the solution which is identically zero,
i.e. the particle remains at rest at the origin.
