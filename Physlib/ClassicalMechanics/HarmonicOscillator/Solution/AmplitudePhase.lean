# Amplitude–phase parametrization

## i. Overview

The state of the harmonic oscillator at `t = 0` is captured by `InitialConditions` as a position
`x₀` and a velocity `v₀`. An equivalent and often more physical description writes the solution as
a single shifted cosine of amplitude `A` and phase `φ`:
  `x(t) = A cos (ω t - φ)`.

Expanding with the angle-subtraction identity,
  `A cos (ω t - φ) = (A cos φ) cos (ω t) + (A sin φ) sin (ω t)`,
and matching coefficients against the standard solution
  `x(t) = cos (ω t) x₀ + (sin (ω t) / ω) v₀`
gives the change of coordinates
  `x₀ = A cos φ`,   `v₀ = A ω sin φ`.

We implement the forward map `(A, φ) ↦ (x₀, v₀)` as `toInitialConditions`, prove the resulting
trajectory is the cosine normal form above (with velocity `-A ω sin (ω t - φ)`), and implement the
inverse map `(x₀, v₀) ↦ (A, φ)` as `fromInitialConditions`, recovering `A` and `φ` as the polar
coordinates of the phase vector `(x₀, v₀ / ω)`.

## A. The amplitude–phase initial conditions

We define a type for initial conditions specified by an amplitude `A` and a phase angle `φ`. Being
an amplitude and an angle, these are stored as scalars, rather than as vectors as for the other
initial-condition types.

-/

/-- Initial conditions for the harmonic oscillator specified by an amplitude `A` and a phase
  offset `φ`, describing the solution `x(t) = A cos (ω t - φ)`.

  The conditions can be converted to the standard `InitialConditions` format using the
  `toInitialConditions` function. -/

## B. Conversion to standard initial conditions

Using `x₀ = A cos φ` and `v₀ = A ω sin φ`, we convert amplitude–phase data to the standard initial
position and velocity at `t = 0`.

  `x₀ = A cos φ` and `v₀ = A ω sin φ`.

  section E.3 for the correctness proofs. -/

## C. The trajectory in normal form

The trajectory built from amplitude–phase data is exactly the single cosine
`x(t) = A cos (ω t - φ)`, with velocity `v(t) = -A ω sin (ω t - φ)`. In the position identity the
factor `1 / ω` of the standard solution cancels the `ω` in `v₀ = A ω sin φ`, which uses `ω ≠ 0`.

## D. Recovering the amplitude and phase

The inverse map `(x₀, v₀) ↦ (A, φ)` must solve `x₀ = A cos φ` and `v₀ / ω = A sin φ`. Recovering
the angle with the real `arctan` covers only `(-π/2, π/2)` and forces a case split at `x₀ = 0`; we
instead embed the phase vector as the complex number `z = x₀ + (v₀ / ω) i` and read off `A = ‖z‖`
and `φ = Complex.arg z`, with `arg` in the canonical range `(-π, π]`. The degenerate state
`x₀ = v₀ = 0` is covered by the convention `arg 0 = 0`, so no case split is needed.

We prove that converting initial conditions to amplitude–phase form and back returns the original
initial conditions.

-/

/-- Recover amplitude–phase data from standard initial conditions, as the polar coordinates of the
  phase vector `(x₀, v₀ / ω)` embedded as `z = x₀ + (v₀ / ω) i`: the amplitude is `‖z‖` and the
  phase is `Complex.arg z`.
