# Parseval's identity in norm-square form

Mathlib states Parseval's identity in polarized, `𝕜`-valued form:
`HilbertBasis.hasSum_inner_mul_inner` gives `∑' i, ⟪x, b i⟫ * ⟪b i, y⟫ = ⟪x, y⟫`. This file states
the diagonal, real-valued form `‖x‖² = ∑' i, ‖⟪b i, x⟫‖²`. The two differ in the type of their
summands, so the real-valued form is not a substitution instance of the polarized one.

The real-valued form is the shape consumers state coefficient decay in, and it is the
`OrthogonalL2Bases` roadmap's Part A3 acceptance criterion `‖f‖² = ∑' n, ‖⟪ψₙ, f⟫‖²`; its instance
for the Hermite basis is `TauCeti.tsum_norm_sq_inner_hermiteFunctionLp`.

## Main declarations

* `HilbertBasis.hasSum_norm_sq_inner` — Parseval in norm-square form, as a `HasSum` statement.
* `HilbertBasis.tsum_norm_sq_inner` — the same identity as an equation between a `tsum` and `‖x‖²`.
