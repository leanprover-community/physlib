# The dual of the complex covector representation

How dual complex covectors transform, on the dual basis.

## i. Overview

A covector representation induces one on the dual space, and a classification of invariant
tensors has to know how the dual basis transforms. For the complex covectors
`Lorentz.CoℂModule` the answer is that dual covectors transform contravariantly: the dual
basis vector `e^μ` goes to the combination of dual basis vectors given by the column `μ` of the
complexified Lorentz matrix. This is the complex analogue of
`Lorentz.CoVector.sl2Rep_dual_dualBasis`, and is obtained from
`Representation.dual_apply_dualBasis` with the transposed inverse matrix read off from
`Lorentz.complexCoBasis_ρ_apply`.

## ii. Key results

- `Lorentz.CoℂModule.SL2CRep_dual_dualBasis` : dual complex covectors transform by the columns
  of the complexified Lorentz matrix.

## iii. Table of contents

- A. The dual representation on the dual basis

## iv. References

The complex covector representation is in
`Physlib.Relativity.Tensors.ComplexTensor.Vector.Pre.Basic`.
